computers late last week, locking users' files and demanding Bitcoin payment to unlock them. \nThe attack, called WannaCry (or WannaCrypt), is a lesson to both the IT industry and consumers, Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith argued in a blog post Sunday. But most of all, it is a wake-up call for governments, whose stockpiling of software vulnerabilities can be as dangerous as getting their missiles stolen. \nSEE ALSO: Get ready for a possible 'second wave' of that massive global cyberattack\nAccording to Smith, all Windows computers that are fully updated are safe from the attack, and Microsoft has been \"working around the clock since Friday to help all our customers who have been affected by this incident.\"\nAnd while the attack shows how important it is for users and companies to keep their computers updated -- as well as tech companies such as Microsoft to promptly release security updates and make sure their users get them -- a big part of the responsibility lies, Smith argues, on government agencies which should rethink the practice of keeping zero-day software exploits secret. \n\"An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen\"\n\"This attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem. (...) We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,\" wrote Smith. \nThe exploit that WannaCry is based on is called \"EternalBlue\" and comes from a trove of exploits stolen from the NSA and released on the web by a group of hackers called the Shadow Brokers.

Mother! will hit theaters this October.\nWATCH: Make your life easy with this piggyback child carrier"},"shares":{"twitter":462,"google_plus":10,"facebook":74,"linked_in":5,"total":551},"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2cVqExNKbzuDfU30wxWRf7gKdVM=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45687%2Ff3abb5b3-8421-47d2-99cc-3f009f5653e2.png","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dEb8k7qAc-PrFmj5sSi9Xtr53iM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45687%2Ff3abb5b3-8421-47d2-99cc-3f009f5653e2.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E5PjJYc4MIeZOYKRT8kAcJlVhTA=/175x175/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45687%2Ff3abb5b3-8421-47d2-99cc-3f009f5653e2.png","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/EGs0GFZ9mlOAeRQ_qzp5pHRyvDg=/350x350/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45687%2Ff3abb5b3-8421-47d2-99cc-3f009f5653e2.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PwODjfvJOs1UsbXroh_3cl7Ek4M=/80x80/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45687%2Ff3abb5b3-8421-47d2-99cc-3f009f5653e2.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UlVnO3mrbsenGpzyd-XG4bWzp3A=/160x160/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45687%2Ff3abb5b3-8421-47d2-99cc-3f009f5653e2.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rgFQVq","display_title":"Jennifer Lawrence tears her heart out for you in the poster for 'Mother!'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"3Y0NLD3lGg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"We know it's meant to be a horror, but oh wow.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Jennifer Lawrence tears her heart out for you in the poster for 'Mother!'"},{"_id":"5918d2e8f11b2c336b000f81","id":"2017/05/14/rick-and-morty-alien-convenant","title":"Rick and Morty discover key to defeating 'Alien' facehuggers","title_tag":null,"author":"Adario Strange","post_date":"2017-05-14T21:57:59+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 14 May 2017 21:57:59 +0000","formatted_date":" 12 hours ago","formatted_shares":"616","sort_key":"1Da1wz","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/14/rick-and-morty-alien-convenant/","content":{"plain":"Of the myriad ways planet miners and space soldiers have tried to defeat the xenomorphs from Alien a new method from none other than Rick and Morty may hold the key. \nIn a new video from Adult Swim, the animated dimension traveling duo encounter a deadly facehugger, the parasite that plants alien eggs in humans.

But with the added heft of Google-owned Waymo (and, presumably, the global mapping information, consumer data, and massive cash war chest of its parent company), Lyft's chances versus Uber in the coming autonomous vehicle wars just got a lot better. \nIn fact, with this partnership, some might even now call Lyft the favorite to win the early rounds of the nascent autonomous ride-hailing market competition. \nJust last year, Lyft co-founder John Zimmer claimed that the majority of Lyft vehicles would be autonomous within five years. Although some scoffed at the seemingly ambitious predication at the time, it could be that Zimmer knew this deal, or something like it, was in the making for Lyft when he offered that bold forecast. \nAn additional wrinkle in the story for Uber is the fact that it's currently locked in a lawsuit brought against it by Waymo over alleged stolen trade secrets. But however that lawsuit shakes out, Waymo's partnership with Lyft is just another in a long string of bad news for Uber in recent months. l\nFurther details regarding the specifics of the collaboration between Waymo and Lyft haven't been revealed, but Waymo (formerly known as the Google self-driving car project) did offer comment via a spokesperson quoted in the report, saying, \"Lyft's vision and commitment to improving the way cities move will help Waymo’s self-driving technology reach more people, in more places.\" \nWATCH: I tried Uber Rush for a day: Here's what happened."},"shares":{"google_plus":13,"pinterest":1,"facebook":128,"twitter":551,"linked_in":15,"total":708},"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iY9fgqzogoHYhV9Gy0RTF-Mhngo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F476520%2Fa4ffddb8-d212-48d4-919a-26823186c92a.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dgC9Pl3-5m5UD8ZzIs5GkkULbmc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45688%2Fe94094f2-3f78-4b77-ae64-ba786f3ae6e1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ltd7im2T9Zx16z-84bka2QLkYKQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45688%2Fe94094f2-3f78-4b77-ae64-ba786f3ae6e1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Au1gk_bPFhye3EstFDIBWumX1N4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45688%2Fe94094f2-3f78-4b77-ae64-ba786f3ae6e1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eFZcfVQej1OlPmJl1nu751azk1w=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45688%2Fe94094f2-3f78-4b77-ae64-ba786f3ae6e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QQL1HzOfpIqBWRu1TgIohgsmFDg=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45688%2Fe94094f2-3f78-4b77-ae64-ba786f3ae6e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rgFlL7","display_title":"Lyft teams with Google's Waymo for self-driving cars","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"AaRMfpFj","data-source":"jwplayer","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"velocity":[159,1000,992,896,769,551,400,282,180,178,211,196,178,174,175,171,170],"show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Lyft teams with Google's Waymo for self-driving cars"},{"_id":"59190fe328cc36266d00004b","id":"2017/05/14/nbcuniversal-buys-craftsy","title":"NBCUniversal is buying an arts and crafts tutorial site","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2017-05-15T02:18:09+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 15 May 2017 02:18:09 +0000","formatted_date":" 7 hours ago","formatted_shares":"645","sort_key":"1Da7gL","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/14/nbcuniversal-buys-craftsy/","content":{"plain":"NBCUniversal is getting into arts and crafts.\nThe media conglomerate said this week that it's buying Craftsy, a DIY tutorial and art supply site, in what Recode reported to be a $230 million deal.\nThe Denver-based startup merges media and e-commerce with paywalled courses on everything from watercolor painting to \"mastering the art of the pizza,\" as well as a catalog of crafting kits.\nSEE ALSO: How Video Platform Craftsy Is Acquiring 1,600 Paying Students Per Day\nNBC plans to tap Craftsy's contributing instructors to appear on various shows across the company's cable and broadcast channels like Bravo's Top Chef and SyFy's Face Off.

People are worried a second wave of cyberattacks could strike around the world on Monday as employees return to their desks and log onto their computers.\nSecurity experts say the unprecedented ransomware attack that on Friday locked up computers across the globe including UK hospital, FedEx, train systems in Germany among other institutions in exchange for payment, could cause even more trouble as the work week begins. On top of that, copycat versions of the malicious software have already started to spread.\n\"We are in the second wave,\" Matthieu Suiche of the cybersecurity firm Comae Technologies told the New York Times on Sunday.\nSEE ALSO: Meet the 20-somethings who stopped a worldwide cyberattack\nOfficials urged companies and organizations to update their Microsoft operating systems immediately to ensure networks aren't still vulnerable to more powerful variants of the malware known as WannaCry or WannaCrypt.\nThe outbreak, which began last Friday, is already believed to be the biggest online extortion scheme ever recorded. \nWannaCry locks up computers, encrypts their data, and demands large Bitcoin payments, which begin at $300 and rise to $600 before the software destroys files hours later. Cyber criminals targeted users in 150 nations, including the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Spain, and India, along with major government agencies, such as the U.K.'s National Health Service and Germany's national railway.\nTwo researchers in their 20's had halted the ransomeware attack  on Saturday after discovering and activating the software's \"kill switch.\" The temporary fix initially helped slow down the rate of infected computers. \nBut some networks may have caught the malicious bug after workers went home, meaning the malware is already there, waiting for employees to power up their computers.\n\"The way these attacks work means that compromises of machines and networks that have already occurred may not yet have been detected, and that existing infections from the malware can spread within networks,\" Britain's National Cyber Security Center said in a statement on Sunday.\n\"This means that as a new working week begins it is likely, in the U.K. and elsewhere, that further cases of ransomware may come to light, possibly at a significant scale,\" officials warned.\nThe cyber criminals, whose identities are still unknown, also rebounded from the kill switch activation by releasing a second variation of the malware.\nEuropol, the European Union's policing agency, said the attack remains an \"escalating threat\" whose numbers \"are still going up\" after a brief slowdown on Friday. The agency estimates some 200,000 victims -- including 100,000 public and private sector organizations -- have been affected since the start of the cyberattack.\nThe 22-year-old British cyber researcher who found the kill switch said he was now looking into a possible second wave of attacks.\n\"It's quite an easy change to make, to bypass the way we stopped it,\" MalwareTech, who uses an alias, told the Associated Press.\nThe WannaCry malware exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that was reportedly developed and used by the U.S. National Security Agency. Experts said this vulnerability has been known for months, and Microsoft had fixed the problem in updates of recent versions of Windows. But many users did not apply the software patch, AP reported.\nSo, in case you needed another reminder, update your software often. And maybe change your passwords while you're at it.\n\nWATCH: This aerial yoga mat doubles as a portable hammock"},"shares":{"facebook":186,"twitter":400,"google_plus":16,"linked_in":15,"total":617},"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IDnMPkAMeUqEIU3zgJh705lxxlw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F476478%2F0fec500f-1eff-4279-8a1d-46131ea223ba.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZNh2DRkVtAlktzQCZ0UA9QR7wyM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45679%2F81a8ff67-cbd7-4d40-8d02-198f53834cc2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CiZXqPvVdIwaGsiSB0ic0JJeftM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45679%2F81a8ff67-cbd7-4d40-8d02-198f53834cc2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/f4jo9cNXAjZ9IgUvk_LLKsUwxZY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45679%2F81a8ff67-cbd7-4d40-8d02-198f53834cc2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lKBOG2QSq0bynU655ckejY-F5sM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45679%2F81a8ff67-cbd7-4d40-8d02-198f53834cc2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6J49eKaA0-IHZ6Wf_ZBOQNCDI2A=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45679%2F81a8ff67-cbd7-4d40-8d02-198f53834cc2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2qGPq6U","display_title":"Get ready for a possible 'second wave' of that massive global cyberattack","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlvy9mnkX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"velocity":[1000,924,812,558,371,64,77,125,94,74,69,62,48,44,43,43,42,42,37],"show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/","tweet_text":"Get ready for a possible 'second wave' of that massive global cyberattack"},{"_id":"5918ef9e28cc364cc300105c","id":"2017/05/14/fidget-spinners-adhd-experts","title":"Experts poke holes in claims that fidget spinners can treat ADHD","title_tag":null,"author":"Maria Gallucci","post_date":"2017-05-15T00:00:28+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 15 May 2017 00:00:28 +0000","formatted_date":" 9 hours ago","formatted_shares":"699","sort_key":"1Da5eY","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/14/fidget-spinners-adhd-experts/","content":{"plain":"Fidget spinners are a fun, relaxing fount of mindless entertainment. But are they really more than a cheap toy?\nSome experts say no. Despite marketing claims, there's no research that shows the wildly popular spinners are therapeutic tools for people with anxiety, autism, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \n\"I know there's lots of similar toys ... and there's basically no scientific evidence that those things work across the board,\" Scott Kollins, a clinical psychologist and professor at Duke University, told NPR on Sunday.\nSEE ALSO: We, your child's school, regret banning fidget spinners after seeing what toy came next\nThat doesn't mean the three-pronged plastic phenomena don't provide any real benefits, or that parents and educators are wrong when they say it helps some children focus in the classroom. But retailers may be stretching the truth when they label these devices as treatments for fidgety behavior, minuscule attention spans, or discomfort in a classroom setting.\n\n\"It's important for parents and teachers who work with kids who have ADHD to know that there are very well studied and documented treatments that work, and that they're out there, so there's not really quick and easy fixes like buying a toy,\" Kollins told NPR. \nAbout 11 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 4 and 17 -- or 6.4 million kids -- have been diagnosed with ADHD as of 2011, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.\nTheir parents often search for help beyond the typical medication, which might make them more vulnerable to marketing efforts that falsely lump these toys in the category of evaluated, proven solutions that help students focus and learn.\n\nAnother expert had a similarly skeptical view of fidget spinners.\n\"Using a spinner-like gadget is more likely to serve as a distraction than a benefit for individuals with ADHD,\" Mark Rapport, a clinical psychologist at the University of Central Florida who has studied the benefits of movement on attention in people with ADHD, told LiveScience earlier this month. \nStill, parents and some developmental specialists have defended fidget spinners, even as teachers and schools banned them from the classroom for being too disruptive. Proponents argue that, under the right circumstances, spinners and devices like them can soothe an anxious student or calm a hyperactive mind.\n\n\"These little gadgets should be called fidget tools, not toys, and they can be part of a successful strategy for managing fidgety behavior if they are introduced as a normal part of the classroom culture,\" Claire Heffron, a pediatric occupational therapist in Cleveland, recently told the Washington Post.\nA 2015 study found that students with ADHD performed better on a computerized attention test the more intensely they fidgeted. Children without ADHD, meanwhile, did not improve their test score with fidgeting.\nBut Julie Schweitzer, the study's author and a clinical psychologist at the University of California at Davis, said it's too early to know whether fidget spinners could deliver similar results. \n\"We need to study them to find if they make a difference and for whom,\" Schweitzer told the Post.\nWATCH: Someone drilled a hole in an iPhone to make a fidget spinner because... the internet"},"shares":{"linked_in":21,"facebook":140,"google_plus":21,"twitter":517,"total":699},"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CPRMNcEvC38B8dRPgWz6iG0xTw4=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F476505%2F81229be8-d397-4b8e-b3d5-0b2dd03e8b7e.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pjRrf5IV0k3JJU7owuGkcRHMQpM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45682%2F24fc9371-dfb6-48d4-a92a-fe77e559e965.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JuOM0oH3YXtl8b547sIDsvhAPrs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45682%2F24fc9371-dfb6-48d4-a92a-fe77e559e965.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Tvjp7DMpPehW25jJ_mIClsIVmBA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45682%2F24fc9371-dfb6-48d4-a92a-fe77e559e965.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZbBr-N5JIMT0ErnjgwpcI2cYdgA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45682%2F24fc9371-dfb6-48d4-a92a-fe77e559e965.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/a3-q49_vi7nIq1Z4j96u9UW3p1M=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45682%2F24fc9371-dfb6-48d4-a92a-fe77e559e965.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rfGmlE","display_title":"Experts poke holes in claims that fidget spinners can treat ADHD","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"6k01AXD0Vb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"velocity":[972,976,973,969,979,956,964,963,961,1000,995,969,965,959],"show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/","tweet_text":"Experts poke holes in claims that fidget spinners can treat ADHD"},{"_id":"5918dd53f11b2c336b000fcb","id":"2017/05/14/black-mirror-playtest-hololens-augmented-reality","title":"'Black Mirror' augmented reality game created using Hololens","title_tag":null,"author":"Adario Strange","post_date":"2017-05-14T22:42:25+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 14 May 2017 22:42:25 +0000","formatted_date":" 11 hours ago","formatted_shares":"768","sort_key":"1Da3UI","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/14/black-mirror-playtest-hololens-augmented-reality/","content":{"plain":"The augmented reality game of whack-a-mole in the popular Black Mirror episode \"Playtest\" may have seemed like a fascinating look at the future but now it's real. \nDavid Robustelli, a virtual reality and augmented reality developer at Amsterdam-based Capitola VR, posted video of a prototype of an AR whack-a-mole game using the Microsoft Hololens.  \nIn a post on UploadVR, Robustelli explains how the prototype app simulates hitting the moles as they pop up and disappear.\nAnd while this app isn't coming to most users anytime soon, it's yet another example of just how hard it's getting to come up with sci-fi scenarios that aren't just previews of things we already have in development.

Assuming the estimate holds, it should hit that milestone well before the two week release anniversary of May 19 rolls around.\nForeign audiences love Guardians 2 as well. The original Guardians ended its months-long overseas run with $440.2 million at the international box office. Vol. 2, which has been out for three weeks in various locations, already has earned an estimated $384.4 million.\nThe question now: does Guardians 2 have what it takes to become the fifth billion dollar movie for Marvel Studios? Both Avengers movies earned that distinction, as did Iron Man 3 and Captain America: Civil War.\nAnd what is Marvel's #5 performer on the worldwide box office charts? Guardians of the Galaxy, which ended its run with $773.3 million. Vol. 2 is certain to crack that figure, but a $1 billion box office might be out of reach given all the summer competition that soon will start to surface.\nBefore the end of May, Guardians will face off against Alien: Covenant, Baywatch, and the latest Pirates of the Caribbean adventure. Wonder Woman follows a week later, on June 2. \nThe first Guardians, on the other hand, released in early August of 2014, a time when summer blockbusters are traditionally winding down. It was considered a surprise success at the time, but its box office longevity had as much to do with the light post-August calendar for blockbusters as it did overall popularity.\nThat said, Guardians 2 already faced its first test this weekend with a pair of newcomers that had a shot at eating into its audience. The Amy Schumer/Goldie Hawn comedy Snatched opened at #2 with an estimated $17.5 million and fellow newcomer King Arthur: Legend of the Sword landed behind it at #3, with $14.7 million.\nNeither Snatched nor King Arthur fared very well with critics, but that's not always the best metric for box office performance. Just look at the ticket sales for any Transformers movie as proof. \nDon't bother trying to position Snatched as a counter-programming play; Schumer and Hawn together have broad, cross-gender appeal within a variety of age groups. The more likely explanation for both it and King Arthur falling short: lack of interest, coupled with competition from the hot, new Marvel blockbuster.\nAlien should present a tougher test for Guardians next week, with its built-in audience and the geek appeal of director Ridley Scott returning for another Xenomorph-fueled sci-fi story.\nAll box office figures and estimates provided by comScore and Box Office Mojo.\nWATCH: Some of the best movie shots are those between

the placement of a birthday cake surfaced on Saturday. \nMinta and Cameron Burke were heading to Las Vegas from JFK Airport in New York on Flight 611 on May 3 to celebrate Minta's 40th birthday with their children when an incident between the family and the airline caused the entire family to be kicked off the plane, despite the NYPD admitting to the family that they did nothing wrong.\nAccording to ABC 7, the incident started when someone in the family placed a birthday cake in the overhead bin, which is not allowed. The family says that a flight attendant told Cameron to move the cake to underneath his seat, which he did, but claims that the situation escalated when a second flight attendant got involved.\nSEE ALSO: Royal Jordanian Airlines just trolled America's 'laptop ban'\n\nJersey City family kicked off flight over a cake. @JetBlue says passenger was agitated/security risk. Video appears to tell different story. pic.twitter.com/q0zQzNbHoa— CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) May 14, 2017\n\n\"You know, you could see the gestures - then she was pointing to her, did you tell him he couldn't put anything in the overhead compartment? I had approached them, and I said everything was fine, and she said, 'sir, this does not involve you. When she told me I had been non-compliant, then I said 'ma'am, had you been drinking?' because her behavior was not normal,\" Cameron told ABC 7.\nEventually, police were called to sort everything out. In the clip, tweeted by ABC 7 reporter CeFaan Kim the family is visibly upset, and their son can be seen crying over the ordeal. \n\"No one's in any trouble,\" an officer can be heard reassuring the family.\n\"Daddy, I feel scared,\" Cameron's daughter tells him.\nAfter discussing the incident with the airline staff, the officer then returns to the family to break the bad news. Despite reassuring the family that \"no one did anything wrong,\" the airline forced the family to deplane and rebook their flight.\n\"Unfortunately, you know, they're going to have to rebook everyone.\"\nThe officer was quick to point the finger at the airline, saying JetBlue requested the family be removed. \n\"I'm sorry!\" the boy tells the officer as his voice cracks. \nJetBlue issued Mashable the following statement.\nDuring boarding, the customers stowed their cake and other items in an overhead bin reserved for safety and emergency equipment, and refused multiple requests from the crew to remove the items. Federal regulations require that the emergency equipment remain unobstructed during the flight. The customers became agitated, cursed and yelled at the crew, and made false accusations about a crew member’s fitness to fly. After the customers refused to speak with a team leader about the situation, the Port Authority Police Department was called and the entire aircraft deplaned. The Captain determined the customers’ behavior demonstrated a risk for additional escalation in air and would not be allowed to fly. A full refund was given. The remaining customers re-boarded and the flight departed without further interruption.\nAll customers are welcome to bring onboard one carry on and one personal item, including cakes, within the size limits.\nThe video circulating does not depict the entire incident and only starts after the objectionable behavior occurred and law enforcement was called.\nCameron maintains that he never raised his voice or cursed on the plane and says that his family was never given a definitive answer for why they were kicked off the flight.\nIt's unclear what exactly happened before Cameron started filming, but it appears as if his comment about the flight attendant being intoxicated is part of the reason they were booted from the flight. According to Kim, there is an extended video of the incident, and Mashable has requested he post the entire video to YouTube.\nThe family was refunded for their tickets at the terminal immediately after deplaning.

If appointed, he'll oversee key scientific work on everything from nutrition to the effects of rising temperatures on food supplies.\nSEE ALSO: Here's why thousands of scientists are (and aren't) marching on Saturday\nThe top position is supposed to be filled by \"distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics,\" according to the 2008 Farm Bill. \nYet Clovis, who was one of Trump's earliest campaign advisers, doesn't exactly check off the required boxes, according to reports by the Washington Post, ProPublica, and other outlets.\n\nHe does hold bachelor's degrees in political science and government, along with a master's in business administration and a doctoral degree in public administration, his LinkedIn page shows. He's also spoken publicly of his 25-year service in the Air Force and emphasizes his expertise in foreign policy and national security. \nBut Clovis has never taken a graduate course in science and has published almost no academic work -- two bare-minimum requirements of any fledgling scientist. \nInstead, the Iowa native is better known for his conservative radio show \"Impact With Sam Clovis\" and for passionately advocating for Trump on television. He also made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 2014.\nClovis's leadership of the USDA's Research, Education, and Economics division would be his third agriculture-related role with Trump. On the campaign trail, Clovis advised Trump on agricultural issues, and he is now the senior White House adviser within the USDA. \n\nAs the division's undersecretary, Clovis would oversee the USDA's extensive scientific mission and its economic bureaus, including the Natural Agricultural Statistics Service and the Economic Research Service.\nCatherine Woteki, who was the undersecretary during the Obama administration, said appointing Clovis to that position would be like tapping someone without a medical background to lead the National Institutes of Health, one of the world's foremost medical research centers. \n\"This position is the chief scientist of the Department of Agriculture. It should be a person who evaluates the scientific body of evidence and moves appropriately from there,\" she told ProPublica.\nThe USDA's undersecretary for research, education, and economics has historically consulted on a wide range of issues for which a scientific understanding is crucial, including the Zika and Ebola outbreaks and homeland security issues related to food safety, Woteki told the news organization.\n\nClimate change-related issues also fall under the undersecretary's purview. Yet Clovis has decried the mainstream scientific consensus that human activity is primarily to blame for global warming as \"junk science.\"\n\"I don’t think there’s any substantive information available to me that doesn’t raise as many questions as it does answers,\" Clovis said in a 2014 interview with Iowa Public Radio. \"So I'm a skeptic.”\nThe Trump administration's hostility toward scientists and their research hardly comes as a surprise. \nLast week, the Environmental Protection Administration said it would not reappoint half the expert members of a board that advises the agency on the integrity of its science. \nInstead, Trump's EPA will potentially consider replacing the academic scientists with people who work for chemical and fossil fuel companies -- as in, the industries whose pollution the EPA is supposed to regulate.\nWATCH: This is the biggest indoor vertical garden in the world"},"shares":{"facebook":982,"twitter":501,"google_plus":20,"linked_in":7,"pinterest":3,"total":1513},"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9Bui-CwX4m6gTClT4jt4OdSswJI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F476451%2Ff7c1cd48-2827-4cb1-b588-4042a8fe075d.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4GH498ketZUA8JT8Nuw0hJcnvB8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45674%2Fe0a975a6-1802-49b6-83e3-a2a66c0ca558.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KxVOigSc023yZaWmG9deKyTnklU=/638x368/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45674%2Fe0a975a6-1802-49b6-83e3-a2a66c0ca558.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jwCkw6e82FyncTI9BKlUtWsIE4E=/1276x736/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45674%2Fe0a975a6-1802-49b6-83e3-a2a66c0ca558.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YNdQztAd5s2WEJHUFtjKiH9pz0I=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45674%2Fe0a975a6-1802-49b6-83e3-a2a66c0ca558.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TQMK7pDIi5KlHpQphJrNaZ5u5cw=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45674%2Fe0a975a6-1802-49b6-83e3-a2a66c0ca558.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ucDW9QALRYwN_lJK-CHzSn7bxsY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45674%2Fe0a975a6-1802-49b6-83e3-a2a66c0ca558.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YPmi42hqb4LeJGsrrbujnrouIP0=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45674%2Fe0a975a6-1802-49b6-83e3-a2a66c0ca558.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rfUrQP","display_title":"Trump might pick a non-scientist to be USDA's 'chief scientist'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"tcBfLWRh","data-source":"jwplayer","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Who needs expertise and qualifications, anyway?","show_sponsorship":true,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/","tweet_text":"Trump might pick a non-scientist to be USDA's 'chief scientist'"},{"_id":"59188db728cc364cc3000e77","id":"2017/05/14/trump-resist-flash-mob-indivisible-san-pedro","title":"Anti-Trump flash mob breathes actual life into the #resist hashtag","title_tag":null,"author":"Adam Rosenberg","post_date":"2017-05-14T17:02:45+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 14 May 2017 17:02:45 +0000","formatted_date":" 16 hours ago","formatted_shares":"1.8k","sort_key":"1D9Y8C","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/14/trump-resist-flash-mob-indivisible-san-pedro/","content":{"plain":"What do you get when you cross 200 protesters with a Donald Trump-branded golf course?\nIt's not a joke; this actually happened, and those 200 protesters hit the dirt at southern California's Trump National Golf Club to spell out an emphatic statement: \"RESIST!\"\nSEE ALSO: Scorching 'SNL' Weekend Update hits Comey firing, Trump-Russia\nThe group in question is the San Pedro chapter of Indivisible, a nationwide network that formed after the 2016 election.
